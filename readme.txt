A simple plugin for adding, enqueuing and organising common items into the Head tag without hard-coding.

== Description ==

WP Headmaster is a free plugin to help correctly include, organise and enqueue common items into your theme's head tag. WP Headmaster has been designed to work perfectly alongside other popular plugins like Yoast's Wordpress SEO, without any cross-over. WP Headmaster will continue to develop, but at present comes with the following features:

* Google Analytics - Simply add in your unique tracking ID and select from either Universal or Classic tracking. The GA tracking code will be added last within the head.
* Page/Post specific CSS and JavaScript - Add inline scripts and styles from a handy Meta Box available on each post and page.
* Icons - Upload your website's Favicon and Apple Touch Icon.
* jQuery - Choose to include jQuery either locally or from Google's hosted API.
* Script Library - Enable popular JavaScript files including Respond.js and Modernizr.
* Inline JavaScript - If you wish to add any inline site-wide JavaScript to your <head> simply include it in the field.
* Web Fonts - Embed your chosen fonts from Google Web Fonts, Adobe Edge Web Fonts and Typekit.
* Meta Author Tag - Is dynamically populated with the original author and last to modify the page.
